This is my repo where I practice my coding skills; solving algorithms and data structure problems. <br />
There's also some mini projects too!
## Sections:
### Cracking the Coding Interview (CTCI)
My own solutions to the problems from the famous book by Gayle Laakmann McDowell<br />
Includes time and space complexity analysis, and also explanations to my solutions
